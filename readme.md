use ←, space, → keys (space for cover task, L/R for probe)

Spritesheet has 100x100 images, 24 images total (see e.g. https://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src/loader/sprite%20sheet/load%20sprite%20sheet.js&v=3.54.0 for spritesheet loading)

Should target IE? Older people, older browsers

Font at least 19px (for old folks), and see here for more guidance wrt line spacing, etc. https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/display/section-3-3/

# Order of events

- Initial instructions
- 10 trials with 4 noise, 1.5-2 sec exposure and 0.5sec ISI (0.25sec online feedback)
- Feedback, now warn faster & no feedback
- 10 trials with 4 noise, 0.5 sec exposure and 0.5sec ISI (no online feedback)
- Feedback, now real deal (n minutes continuous, no breaks)
- 288 trials, 58 noise (0.5 exposure, 0.5 ISI)
- Feedback, click to continue
- Instructions (now we'll see if certain sets of stimuli more familiar)
- Triplet tests, with left/right selection & down button to continue
- Done, thx

# Learning/Exposure Phase

- 0.5s exposure to shape, 0.5s ISI
- Press key when see patch on stimulus
- Each triplet presented 24 times (4 triplet types x 24 repeats = 288 trials)
- Triplets never in immediate succession (x ABC-ABC)
- Pairs of triplets never in immediate succession (x ABC-DEF-ABC-DEF)
- Evenly space triplets by thirds (so 8 repeats of each triplet type per third)
- no breaks
- No feedback about cover performance (until end of block?)
- Show fractal on 20% of trials (ish-- 288/5 doesn't work) (so 58 trials?)
- Do a few practice trials before jumping in via novel stimuli (just to get the gist)

# Test phase

- Counterbalance left vs right shown first, and foil vs real shown first (8 repeats, so can do 2 of each)
- Be clear that left arrow means left side, right means right (one person from original did left for first, right for second)
- Press L/R to choose, down arrow to continue to next trial
- 0.5s exposure + 0.5s ISI for each triplet presentation, with 1s between presentation
- Add fixation cue to presentation side 1s before presentation
- down button hit -> 1s delay (show fix cue on side) -> triplet presentation -> 1s delay (cue on opposite side) -> triplet presentation
- If not sure, encourage guessing!
